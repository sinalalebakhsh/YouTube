Headless bundle

A headless bundle is a bundle that is configured to not get published anywhere:

    It will have no Permalink and no rendered HTML in public/.
    It will not be part of .Site.RegularPages, etc.

But you can get it by .Site.GetPage. Here is an example:

{{ $headless := .Site.GetPage "/some-headless-bundle" }}
{{ $reusablePages := $headless.Resources.Match "author*" }}
<h2>Authors</h2>
{{ range $reusablePages }}
    <h3>{{ .Title }}</h3>
    {{ .Content }}
{{ end }}

In this example, we are assuming the some-headless-bundle to be a headless bundle containing one or more page resources whose .Name matches "author*".

Explanation of the above example:

    Get the some-headless-bundle Page “object”.
    Collect a slice of resources in this Page Bundle that matches "author*" using .Resources.Match.
    Loop through that slice of nested pages, and output their .Title and .Content.

A leaf bundle can be made headless by adding below in the front matter (in the index.md):
